## What is EduGuide?
This application is a University Course Recommendation System that helps students plan their academic paths by recommending suitable courses based on their completed courses, the degree requirements, prerequisites, and course dependencies. The core of the system uses a graph data structure to represent courses and their prerequisite relationships. This enables efficient traversal and decision-making when generating personalized course paths.
